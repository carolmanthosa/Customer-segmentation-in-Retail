# Customer Segmentation in E-Commerce Using RFM Analysis and K-Means Clustering

Project Overview

This project performs customer segmentation in an e-commerce context using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis combined with K-Means clustering. The goal is to understand customer behavior, identify high-value segments, and implement targeted marketing strategies to optimize business outcomes.

### Use Case

Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

Identify trends in monthly product sales and customer spending.

Reduce marketing risks by directing campaigns toward specific customer segments.

Improve marketing efficiency and engagement through targeted strategies.

### Objective

- Gain insights into monthly product sales.

- Analyze customer spending patterns monthly.

- Reduce risks in deciding where, when, and to whom marketing efforts should be directed.

- Increase marketing efficiency by focusing on specific customer segments.

### Methodology

- RFM Analysis

- Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase.

- Frequency: How often a customer purchases.

- Monetary: How much a customer spends.

- K-Means Clustering
- Applied to RFM metrics to identify distinct customer segments.

- Customers are grouped into actionable clusters to inform marketing strategies.

### Customer Segments and Recommendations
Cluster	Segment Name	Characteristics	Recommendations
0 üíö	Loyal Customers	Previously active, high-spending, currently inactive	Personalized re-engagement campaigns, time-sensitive discounts

2 ‚ùå	Lost Cheap Customers	Low frequency, low spend, no recent purchases	Automated/low-cost reactivation, A/B test simple offers, limit marketing spend if ROI is low
3 ü•á	Best Customers	Frequent, high-spending, recent purchases	Loyalty programs, VIP perks, exclusive offers, upselling/cross-selling
